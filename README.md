# Mesh - A 3D entanglement

An online network for sharing and visualising 3D models.
Each user has a portfolio (private and public), circles of connections with other users and can participate in a collaborative management of modeling projects (with basic version control and group chat).

Models can be exported to a printable 3D format, or to modeling tools (such as Blender) and game engine toolsets (unity).
